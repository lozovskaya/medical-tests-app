# Health Test Manager 

## Android Application

Health Test Manager is an Android app that simplifies the way users manage and track their medical test results. It allows users to upload PDF files from various medical labs (or to add the results manually), extract key data using computer vision, and store the results locally for easy access. Users can visualize trends over time to monitor their health metrics, which is particularly helpful when adjusting medication or following a treatment plan.

The project was a part of a term paper at the university ![Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) and was designed as a group project. My part was designing, developing and building the Android app with all the features listed below.

### Tech stack: 
Android, Kotlin, Room Database, Firebase, OkHttp3 for server communication, Python/Flask backend for data processing

### Features:
- Upload PDFs: Add test results from different labs in PDF format.
- Data Extraction: Automatically extract and store key data using a backend-powered CV model.
- Graph Visualization: View trends of important health metrics over time.
- User-friendly Interface: Easy navigation with bottom menu and intuitive design.
- Local Storage: All data is stored securely on the device using Room for offline access.
- Manual Entry: Option to manually input test results for additional flexibility.
- User Authentication: Sign up with an email or Google account, with data encryption for added security.
